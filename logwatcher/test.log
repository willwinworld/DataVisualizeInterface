I have self-doubt. 
I have insecurity. 
I have fear of failure. 
I have nights when I show up at the arena and I'm like,
 'My back hurts, my feet hurt, my knees hurt. I don't have it. I just want to chill.'
 We all have self-doubt. You don't deny it, but you also don't capitulate to it. You embrace it. --Kobe Bryant

If you're afraid to fail, then you're probably going to fail. --Kobe Bryant
